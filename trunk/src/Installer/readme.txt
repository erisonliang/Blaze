Blaze is an application that is being developed in the scope of a
college project. As a matter of fact, it’s my Master thesis. The main
goal is to develop an application that capable of automating the
recurrent tasks that arise from the everyday usage. I’m having a lot
of work researching and coding Blaze, but I’m also having a lot of fun.
I hope you enjoy using Blaze.

Blaze is still work in progress. Therefore, you might find a bug or two.
If you spot a bug, need help or have any suggestion feel free to post in
Blaze’s forums on SourceForge <https://sourceforge.net/projects/blaze-wins/support>.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Seldom, one or more modifier keys may get stuck, such as Alt, Ctrl or
Shift. If this happens, press each stuck key once and it will be fixed.
