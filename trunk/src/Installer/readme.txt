Blaze is an application that is being developed in the scope of a
college project. As a matter of fact, it’s my Master thesis. The main
goal is to develop an application that capable of automating the
recurrent tasks that arise from the everyday usage. I’m having a lot
of work researching and coding Blaze, but I’m also having a lot of fun.
I hope you enjoy using Blaze.
